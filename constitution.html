<h1>Ideals of the Constitution</h1>
<h2>October 2020: How unalienable rights are the Most Important Ideal in the Constitution</h2>

<p>“They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety.” ― Benjamin Franklin, ( Memoirs of the life & writings of Benjamin Franklin, Brainy Quotes) Among Franklin, Jefferson was part of the Committee of Five given the task of drafting the Declaration of Independence, a statement of separateness from Great Britain. In the second paragraph of the Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson states “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.” The second paragraph lists the ideals for the government: equality, unalienable rights, the consent of the governed, and the right to alter or abolish the government. This paragraph lays the foundation of the United States. Unalienable rights are defined as the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Equality is defined as equal opportunities to all. The consent of the governed is defined as the people’s willingness to be governed by the government, and the right to alter and abolish the government is defined as the right to take down the government if the people are unsatisfied. Finally, using goals as perfection as the definition of ideals, the question becomes determining which is the most important ideal out of the major four. Of the four main ideals stated in the Declaration of Independence, the consent of the people, the right to alter or abolish the government, equality, unalienable rights (life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness), the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is the most important of them all.</p>
<p>The consent of the governed, while not the most important ideal, is important because, without it, people will have no power over what the government does. In “The Consent of the Governed: Essential Principles,” Democracy Web: Comparative Studies in Freedom, 2006, it states “...government exists to secure the rights of the people and must be based on the consent of the governed..." (Document C) The Declaration of Independence states that "Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." (Background Essay) When the Declaration was written, the Committee of Five wrote this in because they did not consent to the governing of Britain. Britain taxed them for unreasonable things and did not give them a seat in voting or any representation. Another example of a case where there was no consent of the governed was the Tiananmen Massacre. Students protested in Tiananmen square because they protested corruption and wanted democracy. They did not consent to what the government did, but the government didn’t listen to them and massacred them with tanks and soldiers. As stated in the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson writes that there shouldn't be a government that doesn't derive its power from the people. The right to have the consent of the governed is also important because, in China, where there wasn’t consent, the country experienced a devastating massacre. Therefore, the consent of the governed is a principal component of having a functioning government. In summary, the consent of the governed is important because it is a key element to having a working government. 

</p>
<p>The right to alter or abolish the government is important because it supplies the people the power to alter the government to their liking, and it's also one of the key elements that make up a functioning government. Jefferson supports this ideal in the Declaration of Independence, stating "...whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it." (Document D) Examples of this include the attempted secession of Vermont, where the people wanted Vermont to be a separate state from the rest of the United States. They used an upside-down flag of the United States, a signal for distress at sea, to represent how they felt the US was in disarray. Another example is the Tea Party, a group that supports a smaller government and reduced taxes. Sources: (Document D: Carol Moore Report, July 3, 2008, and  “Declaration of Tea Party Independence,” February 24, 2010) In conclusion, the right to change or reconstruct a new government is important because it is a major contributor to having a working government and making sure the nation doesn't fall into a tyrannical rule. 
</p>

<p>The right to equality is the second most important ideal stated in the Declaration of Independence because it makes sure everyone has equal opportunities, everyone has the same objectives for the government, and sets the foundation for liberty. The right to equality is the second most important ideal stated in the Declaration of Independence because it makes sure everyone has equal opportunities, everyone has the same objectives for the government, and sets the foundation for liberty.  From Diana Pham, Chicago, IL, July 2012, she exclaims “My daughters, like other Americans, had an equal opportunity to succeed. America has given our family the chance to become whatever we choose to become.” Diana Pham and her husband, Vi Luu, arrived in Chicago in 1980 from refugee camps in Indonesia and Malaysia. Diana was asked what she appreciated most about her new country. Diana, coming from a place where ideals did not serve as the foundation for the government, found this change refreshing. Equality is important to provide everyone with the same opportunities and make everyone on the same level. This provides the basis for liberty, which provides the freedom to pursue any religion, political views, and cultures. (Source; Document A, Diana Pham, Chicago, IL, July 2012) Thus, equality is important to provide everyone with the same opportunities and make everyone on the same level. This provides the basis for liberty, which provides the freedom to pursue any religion, political views, and cultures.
</p>

<p>The right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness is the most important ideal stated in the Declaration because of its persistence through time and is supported by equality. Andrew Sullivan states in the This I Believe show that “I believe in life. I believe in treasuring it as a mystery…that should never be destroyed... The right to life is the right to live your life, to be free and not under anyone else’s control. While this only applied to white, landowning men, it has now been extended to everyone, similar to equality. Sullivan then goes on to say “I believe in liberty. I believe that within every soul lies the [ability] to reach for its own good...” The right to liberty is the right to have any religious views and behaviors without persecution. He continues, saying “I believe in the pursuit of happiness. Not its attainment, nor its final definition, but its pursuit.” The right to pursue happiness is the right to do things that make you happy, as long as you don’t break any laws. Sources: Andrew Sullivan, “Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness,” This I Believe, National Public Radio,  July 4, 2005. Secondly, you cannot have equality without liberty.  If you are oppressed by the authority because of your view, behavior, or political views, you don't get the same opportunities as people that are not oppressed by having their views. This creates inequality and thus a society can’t achieve equality without liberty. Combining the importance of these three rights with the fact that it’s the basis for equality, we conclude that the 3 unalienable rights are the most important ideal in the Declaration of Independence. 
</p>

<p>In conclusion, the 3 unalienable rights, the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are the most important ideal in the Declaration of Independence because it sets the foundation for a functioning, equal government and establishes these rights as immovable and permanent. Although equality, the right to alter or abolish the government, and the right of the consent of the people, unalienable rights are the most fundamental aspect of having a functioning government.</p>
