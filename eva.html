<h1>Evangelion</h1>
<h2>Thoughts on the series and End of Evangelion</h2>
<img src="img/eva1.jpg" alt="!">

<p></p>
<p>While I will not be writing out the whole lore because that will be too long, I will have a short section that summarizes the beginning.
</p>
<p>Adam and Lilith are the two original Angels that are both on Earth. Angels, children of Adam, invade the NERV base to try to contact Lilith throughout the anime. Any sort of contact between a descendant of Adam and a descendent of Lilith will result in events that will reset all life. NERV’s intention is to stop this from happening, or so everyone thinks. The commander’s, Gendo Ikari,  intentions are to advance the Human Instrumentality Project, a series of events that will combine all human souls together into a single life form so everyone could be whole again. This can be triggered when the Third Impact happens and Lilith absorbs all humans into her egg.</p>
<p>
Evas were created from samples of Adam to fight off Angels except for Unit 01, which was created from tearing off the bottom half of Lilith. Evas can produce A.T. fields just like Angels, which deflect all projectiles until they are broken through by another A.T. field or the Spear of Longinus. The Evas need a soul to operate, too.</p>
<h5>Main Characters</h5>
<p>Shinji Ikari:
Son of the commander, Shinji Ikari is ordered to go to Tokyo 3 and pilot Unit 01. He is overall reluctant to do so and resents his father for leaving him at an early age to go work on the Evas.

</p>
<p>Rei Ayanami: 
A blue-haired girl with mysterious origins, Rei pilots Unit 00 and has a strange affection for Gendo Ikari. She is quiet and doesn’t display much emotion.
</p>
<p>Asuka Langley Soryu:
Hotheaded and eager to prove her skill, Asuka is German-Japanese and pilots Unit 02. She is proud and believes that she is better than the other two children, also saying that Unit 02 is superior to the other two.
</p>
<p>
In the later half of the anime, we see rising tensions between the Children and NERV. NERV increasingly starts to operate in the moral gray area instead of always being right. In Episode 18, Gendo inserts a dummy plug into Unit 01 when Shinji declines to kill an Angel who was infecting an Eva. The dummy plug brutally killed the Angel, at the same time rendering the new Eva unusable and almost killing the pilot. Shinji begins to comprehend how powerful Evas are and how dangerous they could potentially be to the human race. 
</p>
<p>In Ep 19, Unit 01 runs out of battery fighting against an Angel. The Angel exposes the Eva’s core and starts attacking it before Unit 01 goes berserk, negating a power source and moving on its own. This happens when the synchronization between the pilot and the soul inside the Eva goes above a level, so the soul can operate the Eva. Right before berserking, Shinji’s dead mother whispers “I won’t let you die”. This reveals that Gendo inserted his mother’s soul inside the Eva and also explains why their sync rate is so high. 01 starts eating the Angel’s S2 engine and almost breaks out of its armor. Shinji learns that the armor is used more as a restraint for the god-like powers of the Eva more than protection.

</p>
<p>In Episode 22 and 23, we see the descent of Asuka as she tries to suppress her traumatic experiences and her synchronization rate with Unit 02 drops. In these flashbacks, Asuka’s mother is sitting in a hospital room and refers to the real Asuka as “that girl outside” and refuses to speak to the real Asuka. It’s revealed that she went mentally insane when her soul was inserted into Unit 02. Another flashback shows Asuka excited to tell her mother the news that she was going to become an Eva pilot, only to open the door and see her mother’s hanged body alongside the hanged doll. Seeing that she is unable to fight the approaching Angel, Gendo orders Rei to throw the Spear of Longinus at the Angel, an object that can pierce through any A.T. field. After being thrown, the Spear escapes orbit and couldn’t be retrieved.
</p>
<h5>A Reanalysis of the Characters
</h5>
<h2>Up to this point, the insecurities of all three characters are slowly displayed as the series progresses.
</h2>
<p>Shinji is prone to thinking that everyone else hates him. The disappearance of Gendo when Shinji was young led to Shinji’s failure to interact with other characters, especially Rei, Asuka, and Misato. Shinji envies Rei as his father is always affectionate toward her but not him. He is in constant denial of real-life situations and tends to run away from reality. Asuka points out that he also has an apologizing habit even if he did nothing wrong, undoing any trouble he might have gone into. Shinji is afraid of affection in general. All he wants is some sense of usefulness in the world: from his father, from Misato, from NERV, from Asuka and Rei. Quoted from Hideaki Anno himself, “he [Shinji] thinks his life holds no value, yet he is still too cowardly to even commit suicide.”
</p>
<p>Rei is one of a series of failed clones created by Gendo to make his dead wife come back. These clones were made from samples of Lilith, making Rei the harbinger of Lilith’s soul. That is the reason behind his affection for her, leaving Rei without a real purpose to be born aside from being there for Gendo. She starts to disobey Gendo’s orders and sacrifices her life to save Shinji. She has developed feelings for him because he proved that she is more than a tool for Gendo. In the End of Evangelion, she rejects Gendo/Adam’s fusion with herself/Lilith, only accepting Adam’s fusion and returns to Lilith. That triggers the Third Impact because Lilith and Adam are united.
</p>
<p>Asuka demands attention from the other pilots and lives in Misato’s house along with Shinji. Confident and ambitious, she also suffers from insecurities that she cannot do well and the stubborn belief that she is better than everyone else. Without her piloting skills, she thinks that there is no more reason for her to live. Asuka’s conditions stem from the lack of attention she was given as a child (mentally insane mother). She wants to make herself look more mature than she actually is so she doesn’t appear vulnerable to others. 
</p>
<p>Notice that these three make up the mind, body, and soul. Rei being introspective, Asuka being brash, and Shinji being emotional and vulnerable.</p>
<p>Episode 24: My favorite! Shinji meets a new character, Kaworu Nagisa, the designated pilot for Unit 02 after Asuka is too traumatized to pilot it. Like Rei, Kaworu’s background has been deleted and little is known about him. Shinji and Kaworu bond quickly as Shinji finally finds someone who appreciates him. In a surprising turn of events, Kaworu activates his own A.T. field and heads down to the Terminal Dogma. Kaworu, the 17th Angel, is the harbinger of Adam’s soul, and his A.T. field blocks out NERV’s monitor on the situation. Shinji in Unit 01 is sent down to confront Kaworu. Nagisa reaches the Terminal and realizes it was Lilith, not Adam. Sympathizing with the human race and the pain they face as part of their existence, Kaworu chooses to let humanity live over the Angels. In this scene, Rei looks down from above the Dogma and emits her own A.T. field since she is the harbinger of Lilith’s soul: this negates Kaworu’s A.T. field. With his permission, Unit 01 kills Kaworu after a long period of silence.
</p>
<p>Before he dies, Kaworu reveals to Shinji something that really resonated with me: Humans, being the offspring of Lilith, also have A.T. fields around their emotions. They metaphorically serve as walls to protect a person’s feelings from other people.
</p>
<p>“Whether I live or die makes no great difference. In truth, death may be the only absolute freedom there is.”</p>
<p>This is where End of Evangelion and the original ending branch off: the main difference is that End of Evangelion shows the Human Instrumentality Project in action while the original ending focuses on how the characters feel after they are broken. Many fans were dissatisfied rightfully with the original ending because of the lack of action and lack of the actual event happening due to budget cuts. 
</p>
<h5>Original Ending</h5>
<p>In these last two episodes, Human Instrumentality begins as the characters start to merge into one lifeform. Shinji, Asuka, Rei, and Misato face painful interrogations by black-and-white questions displayed on the screen as their souls are combined into a single being. Questions like “Why did you kill him [Kaworu]?” and “Why do you pilot the Eva?” plague Shinji. For the second question, he answers that it is because everyone tells him to do so, and for the sake of mankind. Asuka appears before him and tells him that he is lying, because he pilots the Evangelion for himself, and that he is looking for false happiness. Rei appears and tells Asuka that she is no different. Even when his "world" turns into a void of nothingness, Shinji still deals with attempting to find out the truth about himself.
</p>
<p>Asuka is shown submerged in a lake with her Eva. When faced with the question of why she pilots the Eva, she responds that she wants the praise of others. This stems from how her mother refused to give her any attention and left her with the final image of her hanging herself. 
</p>
<p>In the final episode, Shinji realizes that he wants to keep being his own person. Rei, Asuka and Misato say that if Shinji depends on outward things to define himself, all these things will eventually change and disappear as time passes. His heart and mind can truly change his world. No matter how painful it will be to try to understand others sometimes, Shinji knows that this is still better than being a formless being. 
</p>
<p>Shinji ultimately rejects Instrumentality and accepts that he can love himself. This is followed by the wack “Congratulations” scene where all the characters clap for him.
</p>
<h5>End of Evangelion</h5>
<p>End of Evangelion is a rewrite of episode 25 and 26, lasting about an hour and a half long. It was most likely created after the original ending received extremely negative feedback from fans, getting so severe that Hideaki Anno started getting death threats. The studio, Gainax, decided to make a second ending that I personally liked better.
</p>
<p>The most noticeable difference is that while it is implied that the Third Impact occurs in the original ending, the merging of Lilith’s egg and all human souls is never explicitly shown. In End of Evangelion, the Third Impact sequence is one of the most memorable scenes in the whole series. 
</p>

<p>At the start, Shinji does some questionable things in front of Asuka’s comatose body. These actions reflect his degraded morals, influenced by his responsibility in Kaworu’s death. 
</p>
<p>SEELE, another organization involved with Evas, discovers that Gendo is planning to trigger the Third Impact to be together again with his wife. Using his wife’s soul trapped in Unit 01, Gendo plans to eject the Eva into outer space as a testament to the human race. SEELE’s goals are different. They plan to unite all humanity as one and sequentially unite with Lilith and Adam, so that they can become part of God — the next stage of existence. When SEELE discovers that Gendo is using NERV to advance his personal plans, they send a large portion of the Japanese military to NERV’s base. Since their base was designed to defend against Angels and not people, most staff are killed except the main characters. The intention of SEELE is to seize the Evas and kill the pilots, so NERV sends Asuka in Unit 02 to the bottom of the lake.
