<h1>My 13, by 13</h1>

<h2 class="breaking">
	As I mature and begin to see a bigger picture of how the world operates, I reflect back on some of my past mistakes or actions I should have taken, but didn’t.
</h2>


<p class="breaking">
	Ah, the first day of the new year. Let's hope towards a better year than the last (not a very high bar). As a celebration and a reflection of the new year, I decided to share 13 things my feeble 13-year-old brain thinks are some of the most guiding and important advice I was given or that I could give. 
</p>

<h2 class="breaking">
	1. Make sure you have a secure net of friends who are ready to back you up and support you.
</h2>
<p class="breaking">
	Some of the darkest moments in my life happened in the durations where I felt or just didn't a significant amount of friends. As most things are, quality over quantity is key when it comes to having friends. You shouldn't chase friendships just to boast the number, but stress the mutual caring and connection between you two. The best friends are there for you when you're down, cheer with you when you celebrate. Of course, this requires you return the favor for them. Another piece of mini advice is that other people don't notice the small, embarassing things about yourself. Know when to talk to friends and know when to be independent. In my own experience, my best eras were a smooth combination of friends and alone time. 
</p>
<h2 class="breaking">
	2. Follow-up: Know when to separate yourself from others.
</h2>
<p class="breaking">
	As Nietzsche said, "No one who has true friends can know what true solitude means, even if the whole world surrounding him should consist of adversaries. Alas, I can see that you do not know what it means to be alone. Wherever there have been powerful societies, governments, religions, or public opinions -- in short, wherever there was any kind of tyranny, it has hated the lonely philosopher; for philosophy opens up a refuge for man where no tyranny can reach: the cave of inwardness, the labyrinth of the breast; and that annoys all tyrants. That is where the lonely hide; but there too they encounter their greatest danger." My interpretation of this quote is that the most dangerous place to be is in your own space, truly alone, having nothing to reflect on but yourself and your actions. In my own experience, I found alone time to almost double as productive as time with friends, even if it's tiring to work alone. In that quote, Nietzsche mentions that the lonely philosopher is hated by tyranny. By reflecting on yourself, you'll have no other reference, comparison to others. In this place, you can find a certain peace, a certain motivation for what is right and what to do.
</p>

<h2 class="breaking">
	3. Do not mindlessly do what others tell you to do.
</h2>

<p class="breaking">
	This is pretty ironic for me to say this in an advice post, but notice that the actions others tell you to do are coming from their perspective or worldview. Everyone's situation is different, so don't mindlessly carry out other's methods to success or happiness or wealth. A common example of this is as shown: Imagine a bull and a squirrel in a river. Your goal is to hopefully cross the river safely. The squirrel scrambles away from the water, dripping wet. It says, "Don't go in the river! It's too deep, and you will drown." The bull, however, calmly notes, "You're going to be fine, the water is only up to shoulder level." The first thing you need to consider is that the bull and the squirrel are different sizes: they have different viewpoints and from each one, theirselves are correct. Both of the advice is correct, but you need to consider how tall you are relative to the bull and the squirrel. Then, you can come to a conclusion of whether to cross the river or not.
