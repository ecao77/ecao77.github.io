  <h2 id="list-item-1">1. Socrates</h2>
  <p>
Socrates challenged people’s existing views and made them think in new ways. He suggested counterexamples and made people think again about what they thought they knew. 
Socrates didn’t like the Sophists, who taught how to give a speech for exorbitant prices. He insisted he didn’t know anything, and only questioned.
Socrates refused to write anything down, and his dialogues were transcribed by his student, Plato. These were called Platonic Dialogues and through these, we can understand how Socrates thought.
Socrates was thought to be dangerous and trying to undermine the government. For this, he was forced to drink hemlock and go bye-bye. Plato noted in his Dialogues that Socrates would rather die than stop thinking about how things really are.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-2">2. Plato</h2>

  <p>
Plato believed that only philosophers understand how the world really works, and compared ordinary people to philosophers in the cave metaphor.
In this metaphor, people in the cave look at shadows made by a flame and believe those are the real things. Plato says philosophers break free and realizes those were only shadows, not reality. This is Plato’s Theory of Forms.
If you want to understand a concept, you have to focus on the Form of that concept, not examples of it. 
Plato’s Republic - Plato describes an anti-democratic, imaginary perfect society where philosophers are in the highest class. This society bans art and sites it as a false representation of reality. Plato thought letting ordinary people vote was like letting passengers steer a ship.
Plato went on to be the mentor of Aristotle.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-3">3. Aristotle</h2>
  <p>
Aristotle wrote Nicomachean Ethics, where he writes about true happiness. “One swallow doesn’t make a summer”, a few moments of pleasure doesn’t add up to true happiness.
When Plato would think about things from a distance, Aristotle wanted to explore hands-on, through the senses. He rejected the Theory of Forms and wanted to examine particular examples. (ie understanding what a cat is by looking at a cat, not thinking about the form of a cat)
Eudaimonia - The flourishing or success of happiness. Aristotle thought you could increase your eudaimonia by having the right kind of character.
Aristotle came up with the Doctrine of the Golden Mean; to be brave, you have to be between foolhardiness and cowardice.
One downside to Aristotle’s brilliance was that people thought everything he said was right. This was against Aristotle’s nature to question everything.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-4">4. Pyrrho</h2>
   <p>
Everything is to be questioned. Everything should be doubted. Keep an open mind so you won’t be disappointed.
Anything could be imagination or an illusion.
Our accounts of Pyrrho is mainly written centuries after his death, written down by Diogenes Laertius. 
Pyrrho believed we can’t trust our senses. When he saw a cliff with a steep edge, he wasn’t scared to walk beyond it. He didn’t trust his sights. You can’t be sure an angry dog will bite you, and you can’t be sure the bite will hurt.
Pyrrho thought that since there’s no chance of discovering the truth, there’s no need to worry. He famously said
“What are things really like?
What attitude should we adopt to them?
What will happen to someone who adopts that attitude?”
Don’t commit to any view, be uncommitted. Every desire you have suggests one thing is better than another. Recognize nothing matters, and you will achieve tranquility.
A counterargument would be just because one doesn’t know anything doesn’t mean you should ignore your instincts about dangers.</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-5">5. Epicurus</h2>
   <p>
Epicurus believed that the fear of death was a waste of time and based on bad logic. Epicurus thought of thinking of your death as a way of making living more intense.
He ran a philosophical school called The Garden. 
Believed philosophy should be practical -- the key of life was recognizing that we all seek pleasure.
The best lifestyle is a simple one - one where you are kind to those around you and surround yourself with friends.
Epicurean has a very different definition than what Epicurus believed. This might be because of Epicurus’s rivals smothering the word with a malicious meaning.
Epicurus thought of the time after death as equivalent to the time before birth. They are both out of your control, so you should not worry about it.
“I was not, I have been; I am not; I do not mind.”
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-6">6. Stoicism (Epictetus, Seneca, Cicero)</h2>
   <p>
Accept what you can’t change.
Stoicism - comes from word stoa, a bench on where these philosophers met.
Stoics include Zeno, Epictetus, Cicero, Seneca
Stoics believed we are responsible for what we feel and think. They believed emotions clouded reasoning and judgment. 
As a former slave, Epictetus claimed the mind could be free even if the body is not. Our thoughts are up to us.
Cicero was fascinated by old age; in his book, he tells of the 4 main problems of being a boomer: it gets harder to work, the body becomes weaker, joy in physical pleasures goes, and death is close.
Cicero believed the soul lived on forever, and old people shouldn’t worry about dying.
Seneca stated that it wasn’t how short our lives were that was the problem, it was how badly we spend our time. Drifting through events without finding time for experiences that are the most meaningful is not truly living.
The most fruitful way to live, Seneca thought, was to study philosophy.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-7">7. Augustine</h2>
   <p>
How can an all-powerful god tolerate evil? 
As a child, Augustine was a Manichaean, a religion that believed God and Satan were constantly battling.
Augustine made the Free Will Defence. God has given us free will, but moral evil is a result because of our choices. The betrayal of God by Eve is carried on in every generation, and he believed evil was because of our own sins.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-8">8. Boethius</h2>
   <p>
Boethius’ philosophical thinking occurred when he was in prison waiting for his impending death. 
Boethius’ book, The Consolation of Philosophy, talks about a woman named Philosophy from above lowering her hand to Boethius in a jail cell.
Philosophy tells Boethius that luck always changes; the Wheel of Fortune turns. There’s no guarantee you will be lucky tomorrow if you are lucky today. True happiness should not come from momentary joy, but from inside.
Riches, power, and honor are worthless because they come and go. The only way to be happy is to find it in the pure Form of goodness: God.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-9">9. Anselm</h2>
  <p>
Anselm was the Archbishop of Canterbury. In his book, Proslogion, Anselm claims no one greater than God has been created. 
Anselm’s main argument is that it’s impossible to have an idea of God without him existing. (An artist has an idea of what to draw, and then puts it on the canvas.)
Counterargument: you can’t conjure up a perfect island just by imagining what it would be like.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-10">10. Aquinas</h2>
   <p>
First Cause Argument - there’s a never-ending series of effects and their earlier causes going back endlessly in time - an infinite regress. There never would’ve been a first cause - which is God.
</p>
<h2 id="list-item-11">11. Machiavelli</h2>
  <p>
Should you rule by respect or fear?
In The Prince, Machiavelli writes what he thought as the most effective method to rule.
A prince doesn’t need to worry about being trustworthy. Machiavelli believed an effective prince needed to know how to not be good. The most important objective of a prince is to stay in power.
Because of this very controversial idea, Machiavelli was thrown in prison by the Medici family. 
Machiavelli believed a prince must have virtu. He thought that success depended on a lot of luck, and you can increase this chance by acting quickly and bravely.
He thought it’s better to have people fear you. If you rely on your people loving you, then you risk them abandoning you when times get tough. Machiavelli thought people were naturally greedy and selfish.
The word machiavellian was defined as machiavellian philosophy: lying, tricking other people to get your way.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-12">12. Hobbes</h2>

  <p>
Like Machiavelli, Hobbes thought humans were naturally selfish and are fearful of death.
Hobbes thought the solution to this is to put a powerful individual in charge. The individuals will have to sign a social contract to give up some dangerous rights.
In Leviathan, Hobbes thought without a sovereign, everything would fall apart and society would fall apart.
Hobbes and Machiavelli didn’t believe in democracy because they did not experience the tyranny in the 20th century.
Hobbes didn’t believe in the soul, which was not normal in this time.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-13">13. Descartes</h2>
  <p>
Descartes called waking up from a dream inside a dream a false awakening - this made him think about how we know we aren’t in a dream.
Descartes was a mathematician, astronomer, biologist, and philosopher.
Descartes developed a method of questioning everything, called the Method of Cartesian Doubt.
If there is a tiniest room for doubt something is not, reject it.
You can tell if you’re in a dream by doubting your existence. An imaginary dream can’t make you think you didn’t exist.
Cogito Ergo Sum - I think, therefore I am. If I can doubt my existence, I know this is the reality. 
Trademark Argument - If we know God exists because he left an idea implanted in our minds. We wouldn’t have an idea of God if he didn’t exist. This is a version of Anselm’s Ontological Argument.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-14">14. Pascal</h2>
   <p>
Pascal was a devout Catholic with a very pessimistic view of humanity. He viewed everything as the evidence of the Fall, the act of Adam and Eve eating the apple.
Pascal switches to Jansenism later in his life, a controversial religion at the time. The Jansenists don’t believe in free will and only a few people have been preselected to heaven.
Unlike Descartes, Pascal believed belief in God was about faith, not logic. The evidence doesn’t come from the brain, but the heart.
Pascal came up with the Gambler’s Argument, which was the following:
If you believe in God and God does exist, you get on his good side.
If you believe in God and he doesn’t exist, you lose nothing.
If you don’t believe in God and God does exist, you are on his bad side.
If you don’t believe in God and he doesn’t exist, you lose nothing.
As shown, believing in God only has good effects. What Pascal didn’t think about is that it would be a sacrifice for many nonreligious people to devote their life to religion and be disillusioned. 
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-15">15. Spinoza</h2>
   <p>
Spinoza believed in pantheism, the belief that God is everything.
Spinoza’s philosophy was almost a reflection of geometry. Geometry depends on axioms as starting points and draw conclusions from them. This process is very logical, much like Spinoza’s writing.
Spinoza emphasized reason rather than experiment and observation - an approach called Rationalism.
Instead of believing God loved humanity and responded to prayers, Spinoza thought God was impersonal and didn’t care about anyone.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-16">16. Locke</h2>

   <p>
What makes a person the same over time?
Locke’s pretty much most important view: We have a god-given right to life, freedom, happiness, and property. This influenced the Founding Fathers whom wrote the constitution.
Locke viewed the man and the person as two different things. One could be the same man but not the same person. What you can’t remember isn’t part of you as a person. 
If Person A had Person B’s memories, then Person A is really Person B.  If Person A committed a crime, then Person B should be held accountable.
Locke believed God could only punish people for crimes they remember committing.
	</p>

  <h2 id="list-item-17">17. Berkeley</h2>
   <p>
Berkeley was an idealist and an immaterialist. He believed all that exist are ideas. Anything you are not looking at right now doesn’t exist - something called esse est percipi, or “to exist is to be perceived”.
Berkeley thought that the hardness of a stone pressed against your foot doesn’t mean it exists, but only the sensation, no real physical stone.
Berkeley was interested in the relationship between appearance and reality. If you see a gray elephant, its grayness changes under different lights. Berkeley therefore put color as a secondary quality. 
Primary qualities are shape and size.
Berkeley was kinda wacky but he got a college named after him so who really won.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-18">18. Leibniz</h2>
   <p>
Leibniz was pretty famous for inventing calculus at the same time Newton did, but Leibniz is also a philosopher so that’s pretty fun.
Principle of Sufficient Reason - God could not create an absolutely perfect world. That would just be god. No design would have produced more goodness using less evil.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-19">19. Voltaire</h2>
  <p>
Voltaire was pretty controversial. He was a playwright, satirist, fiction writer and thinker. He was a champion of free speech and religious toleration. 
“I hate what you say, but will defend to the death your right to say it.”
His most famous book, Candide, Voltaire undermined the Leibniz’s optimism of us living in the perfect world.
Main character is Candide. His name means innocence and purity. At the start, he falls in love with his master’s daughter, Cunegonde. He is chased out of the castle after his master finds him with Cunegonde.
Candide and his philosophy tutor Dr. Pangloss travel all over the world through real and imaginary destinations. When he finds Cunegonde, she is old and ugly.
After this, Pangloss and Candide stumble across a bunch of comically bad events and encounter a bunch of people that all suffered terrible misfortunes.
After an earthquake in Lisbon, Pangloss still claims everything that happens is good. He maintains all is well after he sees 10,000 dead in Lisbon. He gets hanged, dissected, and beaten.
Voltaire uses Pangloss as a representation of Leibniz’s optimistic philosophy. 
When anything horribly bad happens (natural disaster, torture, war, rape, religious persecution, or slavery) happens, Pangloss treats it as further confirmation that they live in the best world.
Candide slowly grows over the book (unlike Pangloss) and his experiences make him sceptical about philosophy and wants more practicality in his life. 
Candide ends the novel by saying to Pangloss, “all is well, but we must cultivate our garden.”
The garden metaphor is Voltaire telling us to do something useful for humanity rather than talking about abstract philosophical questions.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-20">20. Hume</h2>
   <p>
Hume, like Locke, believed knowledge came from observation and experience.
Hume didn’t like the Design Argument, an argument basically saying someone had to have designed these complex machines that function in small pond animals and the Milky Way. 
He believed it was bad logic; just because it looks designed, it doesn’t mean it was actually designed. Even if it was designed, it doesn’t mean God was the designer. We see the effect of an action, but we can’t draw the action from the effect.
Continuing this logic, this number of organisms and things are usually designed by a team of people, not one. Hume thought there were always more plausible explanations of what was actually going on.
</p>
 <h2 id="list-item-21">21. Rousseau</h2>
  <p>
  “Man was born free, and everywhere he is in chains.” Rousseau says this in his book The Social Contract. 
Unlike Hobbes and Machiavelli, Rousseau believed humans were born good. He believed it was the envy and greed that came with living together in cities that made us so power-hungry and attention-needing.
Rousseau dedicated The Social Contract to finding a way to stop humans from being greedy and demanding. He came up with the General Will.
The General Will is what is best for the whole community. When people group together, they give up many freedoms. Rousseau believed (this is the tricky part) you can both be free and obey the laws of the state.
True freedom for Rousseau is being part of a group of people doing what is in the interest of that community.
(tricky) If someone failed to recognize that obeying a law was in the interest of the community, then that person should be ‘forced to be free’. This person, who didn’t know what the right thing to do was, would become freer by being forced to conform.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-22">22. Kant</h2>

  <p>
Kant believed we were all walking around absorbing the world through a tinted filter, the human mind. We can’t take these glasses off. Kant recognizes that it is there and how the world would be like to a person that doesn’t have the glasses on.
Reflecting this, Kant was logical and orderly. He never married and had a strict routine every day, so strictly that people set their watches by his walk at exactly 4:30 PM. 
Kant tries to understand the relation between us and reality - metaphysics. Kant pushes the limits of our thought and comprehension.
In The Critique of Pure Reason, Kant explains his thinking. This book is often regarded as dry and obscure. Terms in the book has never been seen before and invented by Kant as he goes. 
Kant thought we will never learn anything directly about what he calls the noumenal world, what is behind appearances. We do know about the phenomenal world: everything we can see and experience.
The noumenal world is on a deeper level.

The main question in Kant’s book is “How is [synthetic] [a priori] knowledge possible?”
In Kant’s jargon, synthetic means the opposite of analytic. 
Analytic means true by definition, for example the statement “All men are male” is analytic because the definition of a man is male. (stop complaining SJWs) This needs no further observation.
Synthetic knowledge requires experience or observation to give us new information. The statement “lemons are bitter” cannot be answered until someone tastes a lemon and decides if it is bitter or not. This requires experience of tasting a lemon to know.
A priori knowledge is known independent of experience. This is kind of confusing as a subject, as empiricists like Locke thought there was no a priori knowledge, but rationalists like Descartes thought there was.
The opposite of a priori is a posteriori, which is looking at something with reference to an outside source.
Kant declared that “5 + 7 = 12” is a priori; it gives us new knowledge without needing observations. This also gives us new knowledge: synthetic.
</p>
<p>
Kant’s morals are opposite Bentham’s, the next chapter.
Kant believed that morality wasn’t just about what you do, but also why you do it.  The reason you do an action tells you what your duty is, regardless of how you happen to feel.
Kant believed decisions shouldn’t be based on compassion and empathy.
If the Samaritan helped an injured man because he thought that would land him in heaven, that would not be a moral act according to Kant. Nor would helping the man because of compassion. Kant thought only helping him because he recognized it was his duty is the only moral way.
Kant thought lying was always wrong. You should never lie - in any circumstances. You should not protect your friend from a murderer by lying. It’s always morally wrong.
He believed that we all have an absolute duty to tell the truth. This Kant called a Categorical Imperative. This is the opposite of a Hypothetical Imperative, for example “If you don’t want to go to prison, don’t kill.”
Contrasted with a Categorical Imperative, that would be “Don’t kill!”. 
Kant thought morality was a system of these. Maxims that are universalizable should be the rules that make up your morality. You would do only things that would make sense for anyone in the same situation. Don’t make a special case for yourself.
In practice, this would be not using other people and treating them with respect. This is at the core of modern human rights theory.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-23">23. Bentham</h2>
  <p>
Bentham didn’t care about the reason you did something, only the consequences that mattered.
Other than being a philosopher, Bentham designed a circular prison, the Panopticon - watchtower in the middle watches the whole prison.
Bentham was famous for coming up with utilitarianism or the Greatest Happiness Principle.
He came up with the Felicific Calculus (aka Happy Calculator). (initial pleasure) + (how long it will last + how intense = how likely it will give rise to further pleasure) - (units of pain that may be caused) = happiness value / utility.
Bentham thought the rightness or wrongness of what we do comes down to the results. If greater happiness results from telling a lie than not, its better to tell the lie. If telling your friend that the jeans look great gives her more happiness than telling her she looks bad then tell her the jeans look great.
Not everyone is guided solely by a desire to maximize their pleasure and minimize their pain. This is developed later by his student J. S. Mill.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-24">24. Hegel</h2>
   <p>
“The owl of Minerva flies only at dusk.” Hegel’s language in his books are much like Kant’s, very obscure and jargon-heavy.
This above statement means that wisdom and understanding in the course of human history will only come fully at a late stage, when we’re looking back on what has already happened.
Hegel’s view on politics influenced Karl Marx. Other philosophers like A J Ayer thought his sentences expressed nothing at all.
Instead of thinking like Kant that the noumenal world lies beyond the phenomenal world, Hegel thought the mind shaping reality is reality. 
Hegel thought that reality is always trying to understand itself. “It’s the gradual and inevitable coming to self-awareness of Spirit through the march of reason.”
Hegel saw history as gradual increases in individual freedom. He believed one way to become closer to understanding was to debate an idea and its opposite.
Out of this, a third complex idea is formed. Then the process happens again.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-25">25. Schopenhauer</h2>
   <p>
Another pessimist, Schopenhauer thought we are all caught in a hopeless cycle of wanting things, getting them, and wanting more things. Our satisfaction is never quenched.
In a way, his philosophy is very close to Buddha’s. He thought if we could recognize the true nature of reality, we would behave very differently and might avoid the bleak features of the human condition.
Schopenhauer was a gloomy, vain man. When he became a professor, he asked to speak at the same location as Hegel. Unfortunately, his talks got no attention and Hegel’s were packed.
The World as Will and Representation - Schopy guy talks about two aspects of reality: Will and Representation. The Will is the driving force that is found in everything living. It makes plants and animals grow and the force that causes magnets to point north. The world as Representation is the world we experience.
Schopy thought of the World was a single, unified, directionless force behind everything. Schopy thought we can see this world through art. 
Schopy claims music is the best and purest form of art; when listening to a Beethoven symphony you are not just being stimulated emotionally - you are glimpsing reality as it truly is.
Because we share the same life force, my guy Schop thought that killing someone is a kind of self-injury. 
Weird thing is Schopy pushed a old woman down the stairs for talking loudly and when she died he wrote “obit anus, abit onus” on her death certificate. (the old woman dies, the burden goes) 
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-26">26. Mill</h2>
   <p>
Mill was brought up in a special way - his father thought that if a child was brought up without distractions, he might become a genius. 
He was raised alone and without playing with children his age. James Mill taught John using Socrate’s method of cross-questioning. This worked. He was a feminist, politician, journalist, and a philosopher.
J. S. Mill developed Bentham’s utilitarian theory, as he thought of Bentham’s pleasure definition as crude.
Would you rather be a content pig or a sad human? Bentham thought the pig, but J. S. Mill thought the human. Mill thought the pleasure you experience as a human, higher pleasures, are always greater than animalistic lower pleasures.
Milly Rock viewed people as trees in a way. If you don’t give them space to develop, they will be twisted and weak. This is defended in his book On Liberty.
Mill thought that paternalism, forcing someone to do something for their own good, was unacceptable when directed to adults.
Harm Principle - Everyone should be free to live as he pleases as long as no one else is harmed. 
Mill hated the tyranny of the majority, the way that social pressures worked to prevent many people from doing what they wanted to do.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-27">27. Darwin</h2>
   <p>
Darwin thought everyone was, far-back, related to monkey-like ancestors. This belief was super controversial at the time. After his book On the Origin of Species, it was impossible to think humans were a godly creations and above all other animals.
The theory of evolution was probably the most influential scientific theory of all time.
Finches on different islands had different beaks for the different fruits and diet on their island, everyone knows this.
Darwin said evolution is a mindless process. It is impersonal and blind, it doesn’t know where it’s going and it doesn’t think about the animals and plants it produces.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-28">28. Kierkegaard</h2>
   <p>
While many people’s takeaway from the Abraham and Isaac story was that to always trust the word of God, Kierkegaard tried to imagine what must have gone through Abraham’s mind as he was commanded to the mountain in his book Fear and Trembling.
Kierkegaard meant graveyard. Most of his writing was about choosing how to live and the difficulty of knowing that your decision is the right one.
In Either / Or, Kierkegaard gives the reader a choice between a life of pleasure and chasing after beauty or one based on conventional moral rules. Aesthetic // ethical.
Kierkegaard’s writing was unclear if his pseudonyms portrayed his own beliefs or the character he created’s. Kierky uses these characters to see the world through his narrators.
Kiekegaard’s books were popular with later existentialists like Camus and Sartre. They liked the theme of choosing what to do in the absence of pre-existing guidelines.
Riches, power, and honor are worthless because they come and go. The only way to be happy is to find it in the pure Form of goodness: God.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-29">29. Marx</h2>
  <p>
Nineteenth century England - workers poor, owners rich. The owners were rich because of the capital. Marx thought that capital was so important that he wrote a book titled “Capital”, or Das Capital.
Marx was an egalitarian, believing everyone was equal. Capitalism was a trickle-down system instead. Poor got poorer and rich got richer. 
Marx wanted the proletariat (workers) to rise up against the bourgeoisie (rich people). Workers of the world, unite blah blah.
Marx called the treatment of people in factories alienation. Factory owners distance people from being human; only to be a cog in a huge system they had no idea of. Only a stomach to be fed to keep production up.
“From each according to his ability, to each according to his need” okay very famous for communism ok.
Marx thought that religion was the opium of the people. It was a drug keeping them in a sleepy state so they didn’t realize their true oppressed condition.
Marx felt past philosophers described the world while he wanted to change it. 
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-30">30. Peirce & James</h2>
   <p>
James was an American philosopher and psychologist. He developed the pragmatist philosophy. This type of philosophy says a thought means nothing if the cash value of a thought is very low or zero.
What difference does the thought make and why you want to know determines the cash value of the idea.
Peirce also wanted to take a more scientific approach to philosophy. If it was an abstract theory that made no difference in practice, Peirce thought it was unimportant.
This is similar to Ayer’s logical positivism. Truth is what works. Is it true that God exists? James thought that it was true because it is a useful belief to have. 
</p>
<h2 id="list-item-31">31. Nietzsche</h2>
  <p>
Joyful Wisdom: “God is dead.” Science killed God.
Nietzsche was appointed as professor at 24 and didn’t conform to any other. His mental health declined and travelled to Italy where he wrote his most famous books. He spent the rest of his life in an asylum.
If God is dead, what do we do? EXISTENTIALISM!
How do we live? What do we value? Nietzsche was a immoralist, a person that believes we need to get beyond morality.
If God is dead, we can create our own values. When others argued that compassion and kindness were always good, Nietzsche thought the patterns of thought and feeling have a history. They were always passed down.
In The Genealogy of Morality, my guy talked about back in Ancient Greece when heroes built their morals around honor, shame and heroism instead of kindness, generosity and guilt. Instead of kindness being a good moral trait, kindness was viewed as weak and needing other people.
In Thus Spake Zaruthustra, Nietzsche wrote about the Ubermensch or the Super Man. This person is not held back by conventional moral codes, but goes beyond them. The Super Man creates new values. 
Although he didn’t mean it, his anti-Semite sister Elisabeth promoted and changed his work to be very popular with the Nazis. She picked out anything that criticized Germany or didn’t support her racist viewpoint. 
Nietzsche didn’t want to remove emotions from decision-making, but chose to emphasize how they work in shaping values. 
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-32">32. Freud</h2>

  <p>
Freud thought that much of what we do is driven by wishes that are hidden from us. These desires control what we do and influence our actions.
Freud let his patients to lie on a couch and let them talk about whatever popped in their head.  This ‘free association’ allowed the ideas to escape. This was the birth of psychoanalysis.
Freud thought the mind represses a lot of thoughts. The Oedipus Complex says everyone wants to kill their father and bang their mom but represses this.
Freud stated that dreams were the royal road to the unconscious. Symbols in dreams would tell us what we were actually thinking. 
If you said these weren’t what you were thinking, Freud would claim you were just repressing your own thoughts.
Later, Popper called psychoanalysis unfalsifiable (bad thing). He said that the essence of scientific research was that it could be tested. 
For example, when someone tries to explain a man’s drowning or saving a child:
Freud would say the man drowned the child because of his Oedipus Complex
Freud would say the man saved the child because he overcame his subconscious
This way, there was no imaginable evidence that could show it was false.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-33">33. Russell</h2>
  <p>
Bertrand Russell made a bunch of discoveries in logic.
Take the statement “The Present King of France is bald”:
1. The first thing implied by this statement is that there is a king of France.
2. There is only one thing that is the king of France.
3. Anything that is the king of France is bald.
For Russell, this statement is false because at that time there was no French king. This is why “The present King of France is not bald” is also false.
This transition in philosophy is called the Linguistic Turn.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-34">34. Ayer</h2>
   <p>
Ayer believed that he found a way to tell if someone was talking nonsense. He called it the Verification Principle.
In his book Language, Truth, and Logic, Ayer said that most of philosophy was gibberish in a movement called logical positivism, a movement that celebrated science.
1. Is it true by definition?
2. Is it empirically verifiable?
“My room is full of invisible angles that leave no trace” is a meaningless statement. Whether it was true or false makes no contribution to humankind.
Opinions don’t mean anything. Ayer said if you said “Torture was wrong” you’re basically saying “Torture, boo!”. It’s not true by definition, and not something we can prove true or false by definition - emotivism or the boo hoorah theory.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-35">35. Existentialism (Sartre, Camus, Beauvoir)</h2>
   <p>
Sartre published a book, Being and Nothingness. The central theme was freedom, and not knowing what to do when free. A human can choose what to do, what to become. Humans are responsible for wanting to do that thing and for responding to your potential failure.
“There is no way to escape the weight of responsibility that comes with being human.”
We are not penknives; not designed for one purpose. 
In The Second Sex, Sartre’s partner Simone de Beauvoir talks about the becoming of a woman. She claims women can decide for themselves what they want to be.
Life doesn’t have a meaning at all until we give it meaning by making choices. Camus related human life to Sisyphus’ rock pull up the mountain. It’s meaningless.
We recognize Sisyphus is happy. Why is he happy? There is something about the pointless struggle of rolling the rock up that makes his life worth living.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-36">36. Wittgenstein</h2>

   <p>
Friends described Wittgenstein as passionate, profound, intense as dominating.
Wittgenstein thought through lectures and didn’t use notes. He told his students to not waste time reading philosophy books; if  they took such books seriously, they should throw them and get on with thinking hard about the puzzles they raised.
In his first and only book, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, Wittgenstein talked about the most important questions about religion lie beyond the limits of our understanding, and if we can’t talk meaningfully we shouldn’t say anything.
“Bewitchment by language”: languages don’t work in the same way. 
If everyone had a box with a beetle in that they never showed to anyone, it wouldn’t really matter what was in the box when they talked to one another about their ‘beetle’.
A man writes in his diary when he has a kind of sensation for which there is no name. Perhaps a specific kind of tingle. He writes ‘S’ in his journal every time he feels this. No one else understands “S” the way he does.
We can’t have our own private language. 
	</p>

  <h2 id="list-item-37">37. Popper</h2>
   <p>
Scientists, like all of us, learn from their mistakes. Science progresses when we realize that a particular way of thinking about reality is false.
Scientists try to prove their theories are false - a valid claim has to be falsifiable. 
Induction is the process of arguing from a selection of observations to a general conclusion. 
If it rained every Tuesday for four consecutive weeks, you might claim that it always rains on Tuesdays. You are always trying to find a Tuesday that didn’t rain. 
Thus, Popper claimed that psychoanalysis was not cool because there is no way to disprove a claim of what a person is subconsciously thinking about.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-38">38. Foot & Thompson</h2>
   <p>
Trolley Problem: Train is on course to kill 5 people tied to the railroad, but a switch redirects the train onto another person tied to the railroad, but avoiding the 5 people - invented by British philosopher Phillipa Foot.
Why is saving 5 acceptable but sacrificing 1 not?
Transplant Experiment - A person walks into a hospital, and 5 people need organs or they will die. Should the person give their organs to the 5 almost-dead people?
Judith Jarvis Thomson imagined a similar case - Instead of switching the lever, you have to push a large man capable of stopping the train. More people are inclined to say to not do it, because it’s basically murder.
Law of Double Effect - the effect that makes us see that the track and the man case are different
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-39">39. Rawls</h2>
  <p>
A Theory of Justice: Design a position called The Original Position. You don’t know where are you are going to end up. You might be intelligent, unintelligent, gay, striaght, male, female. You will end up having a fairer position.
Rawls developed his principles on freedom and equality. 
Liberty Principle - Unalienable rights, free voting, freedom of expression.
Difference Principle - more equal wealth to the most disadvantaged.
</p>
  <h2 id="list-item-40">40. Singer</h2>
   <p>
A child is drowning in a lake. You are wearing $300 Gucci flip-flops. Do you sacrifice your awesome Gucci flip-flops to save the child? Yes. But, to cure an African child of a disease costs $10. Why do we care about the child so much more when we can save 30 African Children?
We are all bystanders to charity, but why aren’t we bystanders to the drowning child. You almost certainly could have a genuine influence on others’ lives.
Singer says that if someone is in an irreversible vegetative state, they should be killed because they have no reason to live anymore. (Unnecessary Suffering)
Thought animal abuse was super serious and to take animals as seriously as humans. He called this speciesist, and remained a vegetarian.
Singer’s philosophy was based on consistency. You treat similar cases in a similar way.
